aihwkit is easy to install via pip or conda.

I had some issues installing it in PyCharm since the package was unable to find my OpenBLAS implementation,
however, I had no issues installing/using it in Linux (specifically WSL in Windows).

Note that you must have OpenBLAS v0.3.3+ installed on your system prior to package installation.

The CPU version can be installed via
	pip install aihwkit
or
	conda install -c conda-forge aihwkit
however you would normally install a Python package (e.g., in a virtual environment).

The build and runtime dependencies are as follows:

BUILD DEPENDENCIES

cmake>=3.18
scikit-build>=0.11.1
scikit-learn
pybind11>=2.6.2

RUNTIME DEPENDENCIES

torch>=1.9
torchvision
scipy
requests>=2.25,<3
numpy>=1.22,<2
protobuf>=4.21.6
tqdm
mypy==0.991

You can then run my minimal_example.py code to ensure the installation was successful.
